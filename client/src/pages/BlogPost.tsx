- Changing default router passwords
- Enabling WPA3 encryption
- Creating guest networks for personal devices
- Keeping firmware updated

### 5. Deploy Endpoint Protection

Comprehensive endpoint security solutions protect individual devices from malware, ransomware, and other threats. These solutions should include:
- Antivirus/anti-malware
- Intrusion detection
- Data loss prevention
- Endpoint encryption

### 6. Regular Security Training

Human error remains one of the biggest security vulnerabilities. Regular training helps employees:
- Identify phishing attempts
- Practice good password hygiene
- Understand social engineering tactics
- Follow security protocols consistently

## Monitoring and Response

Even with preventive measures, security incidents may occur. Organizations need:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Detecting unusual activities or potential breaches quickly
2. **Incident Response Plan**: Clear procedures for addressing security incidents
3. **Regular Audits**: Identifying vulnerabilities before they can be exploited

## Conclusion

As remote work becomes a permanent feature of the business landscape, organizations must adapt their cybersecurity strategies accordingly. By implementing these best practices, businesses can protect their data and systems while providing the flexibility that modern workers need.

Remember that cybersecurity is not a one-time effort but a continuous process of improvement and adaptation to evolving threats.
